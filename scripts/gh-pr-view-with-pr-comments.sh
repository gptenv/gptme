# This script fetches and formats GitHub PR information, including PR description,
# comments, reviews, and review comments, showing them in chronological order.
#
# This script does what I wish `gh pr view --comments` would do.
#
# Features:
# - Shows PR description and metadata
# - Shows all comments in chronological order:
#   - Regular PR comments
#   - Reviews (with special handling of ellipsis-dev[bot] reviews to reduce noise)
#   - Review comments with their code context
# - Handles code suggestions (```suggestion blocks)
# - Shows referenced code with context
# - Skips resolved comments
#
# The output is formatted in sections:
# <pr_info>     - PR description and metadata
# <comments>    - All comments in chronological order
#
# Example usage:
#   ./scripts/gh-pr-view-with-pr-comments.sh https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

set -e

# Input can be either:
#   https://github.com/gptme/gptme/pull/466
#   gptme/gptme/pull/466
URL=$1

# Add https://github.com prefix if not present
[[ $URL != https://* ]] && URL="https://github.com/$URL"

# Extract components from URL
OWNER=$(echo $URL | awk -F'/' '{print $(NF-3)}')
REPO=$(echo $URL | awk -F'/' '{print $(NF-2)}')
ISSUE_ID=$(echo $URL | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}')

# Validate URL components
if [[ -z "$OWNER" || -z "$REPO" || -z "$ISSUE_ID" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Invalid URL format. Expected: owner/repo/pull/number"
